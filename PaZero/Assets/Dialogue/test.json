But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (Laughs, tears out a page of the book) Like that's ever gonna happen.

Shrek exits an outhouse and goes about his day in the swamp.","\n","^In a nearby village, an angry mob gather up to go after Shrek. At night, the villagers head into the swamp and wait outside Shrek's home.","\n","^NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOME","\n","^Villager 1: Think it's in there?","\n","^Villager 2: All right. Let's get it!","\n","^Villager 1: Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you?","\n","^Villager 3: Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.","\n","^Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.","\n","^SHREK: Yes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin...","\n","^Villagers: No!","\n","^SHREK: They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast.","\n","^Villager 1: Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (Waves the torch at Shrek.)","\n","^Shrek licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The men shrink back away from him. Shrek terrifies the mob with a frightening roar, his spit extinguishing all the remaining torches.","\n","^SHREK: (Whispering) This is the part where you run away.","\n","^The men drop their torches and pitchforks and flee as fast they can.","\n","^SHREK: And stay out! (looks down and picks up a wanted poster. Reads.) \"Wanted. Fairytale creatures.\" (He sighs and drops the paper on the ground.)","\n","^THE NEXT DAY - FOREST","\n","^Lines of fairy tale creatures are put in chains and are led into wagons by Duloc Guards. The Captain of the Duloc Guards sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairytale creatures in. Waiting in line is Donkey on a leash and his owner. Some of the others in line include Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Geppetto who is carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer carrying the Three Little Pigs.","\n","^GUARD: All right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up!","\n","^THE CAPTAIN: Next!","\n","^GUARD: (Taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over.

Come on!","\n","^Mama Bear and Papa Bear are locked inside giant cages, with Little Bear in his own cage.","\n","^LITTLE BEAR: (crying) This cage is too small.","\n","^DONKEY: (To his owner) Please, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance!","\n","^OLD WOMAN: Oh, shut up. (jerks his rope)","\n","^DONKEY: Oh!","\n","^THE CAPTAIN: Next! What have you got?","\n","^GEPPETTO: This little wooden puppet.","\n","^PINOCCHIO: I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows)","\n","^THE CAPTAIN: Five shillings for the possessed toy.

He can talk!","\n","^The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head.

I can fly!","\n","^PETER PAN: He can fly!","\n","^THREE LITTLE PIGS: He can fly!","\n","^THE CAPTAIN: He can talk?!","\n","^DONKEY: Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey.

Get him! This way! Turn!","\n","^Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs head first into Shrek's backside. Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him and glares down at Donkey. Donkey looks scared of Shrek for a moment, but he quickly hides him after seeing that the guards have caught up to him.","\n","^THE CAPTAIN: You there. Ogre!","\n","^SHREK: Aye?","\n","^THE CAPTAIN: By the order of Lord Farquaad, I am authorized to place you both under arrest and...(Shrek slowly approaches the group of guards, the guards visibly frightened by him) transport you to... a designated...resettlement...facility?","\n","^SHREK: Oh, really? You and what army? (Smiles)","\n","^The Captain looks behind himself and sees that all the other guards have abandoned him. The Captain tucks tail and runs off. Shrek shakes his head and starts walking back to his swamp. Donkey, impressed by Shrek, follows him.","\n","^DONKEY: Can I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible!","\n","^SHREK: Are you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa!","\n","^DONKEY: Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back there? Man those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that.","\n","^SHREK: (Annoyed) Oh, that's great. Really.","\n","^DONKEY: Man, it's good to be free.","\n","^SHREK: Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm?","\n","^DONKEY: But, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're a mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.","\n","^Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before loudly roaring in is face.","\n","^DONKEY: Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day.","\n","^SHREK: Why are you following me?","\n","^DONKEY: I'll tell you why.

(Picks up Donkey by his ears and tail) It's no wonder you don't have any friends (drops him).","\n","^DONKEY: Wow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest.","\n","^SHREK: Listen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I?","\n","^DONKEY: (looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh...really tall?","\n","^SHREK: No! I'm an ogre!

Who'd want to live in place like that?","\n","^SHREK: That would be my home.","\n","^DONKEY: Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder.
